## 📖 About The Project

**Radio GAMING** is a streamlined internet radio player designed to deliver high-quality music without distractions.

What started as a simple university coursework project quickly evolved into a passion project. The initial concept was straightforward: build a functional radio player. However, as development progressed, I realized the potential to create a dedicated hub for gaming music that I—and others—would actually want to use daily. Today, it stands as a fully featured, cross-platform application that I'm proud to continue updating.
