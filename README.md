Are you ready to immerse yourself in the ultimate music experience? Whether you're a casual gamer, a competitive esports enthusiast, or simply someone who loves great music, Radio GAMING has something for everyone.

Hello, Project Gaming Radio is a simple internet radio player with support for multiple stations. Initially, it was supposed to be an application for passing a course, but I liked it so much that I decided it was worth updating!
