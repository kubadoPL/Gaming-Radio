Hello, Project Gaming Radio is a simple internet radio player with support for multiple stations. Initially, it was supposed to be an application for passing a course, but I liked it so much that I decided it was worth updating!

Made in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and an external ICECAST Zeno FM server.
